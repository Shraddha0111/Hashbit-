Solve the questions given here -
1. Write code to display from 1 to 100 but just even numbers.

let i = 2;
while (i <= 100) {
  console.log(i);
  i += 2;
}

2. Write a function to calculate which can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers. Use switch inside function.

function calculate(num1, num2, operation) {
  return operation === "add"
    ? num1 + num2
    : operation === "subtract"
    ? num1 - num2
    : operation === "multiply"
    ? num1 * num2
    : operation === "divide"
    ? num1 / num2
    : "Invalid operation";
}

3. You need to write a function findTax() that takes a number type variable as an argument which is the salary of a person. You need to calculate the tax amount on his salary by using the Js switch control flow. The tax rates are given below.

if 500000 >= salary > 0 then 0% tax on the entire salary.
If 1000000 >= salary > 500000 then 10% tax on the entire salary.
If 1500000 >= salary > 1000000 then 20% tax on the entire salary.
If the salary > 1500000 then 30% tax on the entire salary.

function calculate(num1, num2, operation) {
  return operation === "add"
    ? num1 + num2
    : operation === "subtract"
    ? num1 - num2
    : operation === "multiply"
    ? num1 * num2
    : operation === "divide"
    ? num1 / num2
    : "Invalid operation";
}

4. Write a function to perform this. You are given two numbers n1 and n2. You need to find the sum of the products of their corresponding digits. So, for a number n1= 6 and n2 = 34, you'll do (6*4)+(0*3) = 24.

function sumOfProductOfDigits(n1, n2) {
  let sum = 0;
  const str1 = n1.toString();
  const str2 = n2.toString();
  const maxLength = Math.max(str1.length, str2.length);

  for (let i = 0; i < maxLength; i++) {
    const digit1 = parseInt(str1[i] || "0");
    const digit2 = parseInt(str2[i] || "0");
    sum += digit1 * digit2;
  }

  return sum;
}
